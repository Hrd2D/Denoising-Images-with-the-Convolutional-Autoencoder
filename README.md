# Autoencoder assignment

Autoencoders are part of neural network family. The algorithm is fairly simple as Autoencoders require output to be the same as input. The Autoencoders compress input data to latent-space representation and then reconstruct the output. In this assignment algorithm divide into two subsets:

**Encoder** – compressing the input data to lower dimensional representation sometimes called bottleneck or latent-space representation.

**Decoder** – decompressing the representation to reconstruct the input as best as possible.
